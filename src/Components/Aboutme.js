            <p className="text-lg text-gray-400 " > Hello! My name is Akshay and I enjoy creating things that live on the
          internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I
          decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out hacking
          together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS! </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-400 py-6 "  > Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at an
          advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led
          design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible,
          inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a
          variety of clients.</p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-400 pb-6 "  > I also recently launched a course that covers
          everything you need to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node
          & React. Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
